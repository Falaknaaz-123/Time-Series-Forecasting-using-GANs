# Time-Series-Forecasting-using-GANs
This is an implementation of Synthetic time series generation using Generative Adversarial Networks for energy storage systems(Machine Learning): 

Variables considered- Voltage (V), Charge Capacity (Ah), Battery Level.

Using TimeGAN, time-series data was generated and the results were visualized using PCA and t-SNE plots. The usefulness and Fidelity of the generated data were devised.

Tech: Python, Keras, TensorFlow.
